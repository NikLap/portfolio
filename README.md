This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Start the application using either just npm or docker

### Using npm

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

### Using Docker

Create a `.env.local` file to store all necessary environment variables and then run:

```bash
docker compose up
```

### Results

Regardless of whether the application has been started using npm or docker,
open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
